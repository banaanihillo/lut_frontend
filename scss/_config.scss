        Sets the background to the primary color,
        adjusted by the given opacity parameter.
        The higher the opacity,
        the more the overlay affects the original background color;
        here, an opacity higher than, say, 0.5 makes the text basically unreadable

        Include this thing to "negate" that effect,
        pushing the overlay behind the actual background,
        essentially making the background color the primary color again:
        z-index: -1;

        Kind of a nice-to-know gimmick,
        unnecessary for now though
